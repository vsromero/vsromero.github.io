Hello, my name is Victor.

I like to build desktop and web applications. As well as learning new techniques and technologies to make building these applications easier.

I also like to learn about information security, machine learning and just cool technologies in general.

I am always looking for new exciting projects to work on.

Feel free to contact me for any questions you might have or just to say hello.
