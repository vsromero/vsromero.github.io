Hello, my name is Victor.

I am a full stack web developer. I like to build amazing applications that will be useful to the end user.

I am always interested in learning new technologies and techniques to make the process of building applications - or the applications themselves - easier, faster, 
more secure, and less painful.

I am always looking for new exciting projects to work on.

Feel free to contact me for any questions you might have or just to say hello.
